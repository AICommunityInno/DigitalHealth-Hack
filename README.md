# DigitalHealth-Hack
This repository contains all the code our team has written on the Digital Health Hackathon 2018

`data` folder contains initial version of the data as well as version with normalized text of patient complaints. In addititon, n-gramms are extracted from text and saved to files with names containg `complaints` words. Also, there are extracted topics done by [BigArtm](https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm) library - all the filenames that contain a word `topics`.
